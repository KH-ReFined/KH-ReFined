**Kingdom Hearts - Re:Fined** is a mod that aims to improve upon the Kingdom Hearts experience by introducing Quality of Life improvements, as well as fixing many of the glaring problems of this port.</div>
</div>

> [!WARNING]  
> Every game within the mod library is currently being rewritten. Releases may take time as a result. Thank you for understanding!

## The Premise

The project has two modes of operation within every game, which alters their featureset.  
- **Re:Freshed Mode** [known internally as Lite Mode] will disable most QoL improvements, and will mainly only leave the bug fixes.
- **Re:Fined Mode** [known internally as Full Mode] will enable all features. This makes the mod illegal in speedrunning.

The project is currently compatible with the worldwide releases on **Epic Games Store** and **Steam**.  
Compatibility for the Japanese releases is underway.  

The project also supports the Steam Deck and most all Linux distros. But setting it up on those may require extra steps. An install guide will be uploaded to the Wiki soon!

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The games utilize OpenKH in order to add in new features and fix some bugs. Please refer to the Wiki for installation guides and general how-to stuff.
> If you need extensive help, <ins>please do not make an issue</ins>, but rather, join the Discord and make a ticket!

## The Featureset

Re:Fined is aimed at improving upon every game in the 1.5 + 2.5 collection that it can, so the featureset for all of them will differ.  
However, there are also features that are common across every game, which you can see below.

#### Reference

1. Cutscenes will by default lock the game to 30fps. This alleviates that.
2. The Save Data is normally locked to a specific account. Re:Fined removes this restriction.
3. Most sound effects are broken (Like Sephiroth's Deflect and Xigbar's Shots) and some boss quotes are missing (Genie Jafar's Beginning Quote, Saix's Desperation Move). Re:Fined fixes this.
4. In the HD remaster of Kingdom Hearts II, the localization team changed the translation of certain attacks to contrast with their usual translations from Japanese. E.g. Ragnarok -> Infinity. This fix reverts that decision.
5. Starting in Birth by Sleep, the player is given an option to retry a forced encounter instead of being sent to the room before. Re:Fined implements this feature to Kingdom Hearts II.
6. In Kingdom Hearts III, the player is able to press "Prepare and Retry" after dying to enter the loadout menu. Re:Fined implements this feature into Kingdom Hearts II.
7. In Kingdom Hearts, there was a convenient "Encounter Plus" ability to make the grinding experience more bearable. Re:Fined implements this ability into Kingdom Hearts II.
8. CrazyCatz00's English Patch for Kingdom Hearts II - Final Mix on the PS2 had an option in the menu to switch from and to English or Japanese voice acting. This mod reimplements that to the games. There's also extra patches to have up to 5 languages at once. Please see the "Official Addons" section.
9. In Kingdom Hearts III, the player can reorganize their magic menu. This feature is neat, so now it's in Kingdom Hearts II. To do this, highlight your magic command and press L2+DPAD to shift around.
10. In Kingdom Hearts III, the player can have up to 3 shortcut sets and can cycle between them by using the DPAD. This feature is neat, so now it's in Kingdom Hearts II.
11. For some reason, in the remasters, the D-Pad is rotated 90* for the controls on the Card Revolder (Down/Up to cycle instead of Left/Right, Right to Reload Shortcut instead of Down, etc.), this addresses that.
12. Because the game's research is still ongoing, this is toogleable only through the config file.
13. Currently not available in Re: Chain of Memories.

## Official Addons

Re:Fined has support for addons that add extra functionality to the game. This is done so that people don't have to download gigabytes of content that they may not use.
