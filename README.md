### Installation

Installing Re:Fined is easy, even though it may seem like a monumential task. Please refer to [this page](SETUP.md) for full instructions.

If you're installing a pre-v4.xx version of Re:Fined, simply extract the archive into the folder with your game and rename the exe's to the vanilla names. Support for them is not provided per https://github.com/KH-ReFined/KH-ReFined/issues/117.

## Purpose

This project aims to improve the game in many ways whilst fixing the errors that the PC ports, and by extension, 1.5/2.5 had.  
Every legacy Kingdom Hearts game will get a Re:Fined counterpart.

## Game Status
