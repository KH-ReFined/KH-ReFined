#### Reference

1. Cutscenes will by default lock the game to 30fps. This alleviates that.
2. The savefiles are DRM'd normally - meaning you can't share savefiles with other people. Re:Fined removes that DRM.
3. Sora/Roxas immediately have MP Bars when the game begins, despite having no magic. This fix will now make said MP bar invisible until the player learns their first magic spell. (Usually Fire in KH1, Blizzard in KH2.)
4. The game originally saves everything to `Documents/KINGDOM HEARTS HD 1.5+2.5 ReMIX\Epic Games Store\[EGS ID]`. Re:Fined changes the path to `Documents\Kingdom Hearts\Save Data\[EGS ID]`.
5. In the HD remaster of KH2, the localization team changed the translation of certain attacks to contrast with their usual translations from Japanese. E.g. Ragnarok -> Infinity. This fix reverts that awful decision.
6. Starting in Birth by Sleep, the player is given an option to retry a forced encounter instead of being sent to the room before. Re:Fined implements this feature to KH2.
7. In KH3, the player is able to press "Prepare and Retry" after dying to enter the loadout menu. Re:Fined implements this feature into KH2.
8. In KH1, there was a convenient "Encounter Plus" ability to make the grinding experience more bearable. Re:Fined implements this ability into KH2.
9.  CrazyCatz00's English Patch for Kingdom Hearts 2 - Final Mix on the PS2 had an option in the menu to switch from and to English or Japanese voice acting. This mod reimplements that to the games. There's also extra patches to have a 3rd language - it can be German, French or Spanish.
10. In KH3, the player can reorganize their magic menu. This feature is neat, so now it's in KH2. To do this, highlight your magic command and press L2+DPAD to shift around.
