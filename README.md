#### Reference

1. Cutscenes will by default lock the game to 30fps. This alleviates that.
2. Sora/Roxas immediately have MP Bars when the game begins, despite having no magic. This fix will now make said MP bar invisible until the player learns their first magic spell. (Usually Fire in KH1, Blizzard in KH2.)
3. In the HD remaster of KH2, the localization team changed the translation of certain attacks to contrast with their usual translations from Japanese. E.g. Ragnarok -> Infinity. This fix reverts that awful decision. 
4. In KH3, the player can reorganize their magic menu. This feature is neat, so now it's in KH2. To do this, highlight your magic command and press L2/LT+DPAD to shift around.
5. CrazyCatz00's English Patch for Kingdom Hearts 2 - Final Mix on the PS2 had an option in the menu to switch from and to English or Japanese voice acting. This mod reimplements that to the games.
6. The party will wear their Halloween costumes in the days between October 31st and November 2nd (inclusive). Whilst they wear their Christmas costumes in the days between December 24th and January 1st (also inclusive).
7. Starting in Birth by Sleep, the player is given an option to retry a forced encounter instead of being sent to the room before. Re:Fined implements this feature to KH2 and it will replace the continue option. To revert back to and from the continue option, you can use the left and right D-Pad buttons.
