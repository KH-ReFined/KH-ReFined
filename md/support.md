## Something went wrong. What now?

Well, with these types of projects it is inevitable that something goes horrifyingly wrong.  
Luckily, we are by your side in every step of the way!

If you have a problem that you like to report, but do not want much interaction, you can  
submit an issue to the <a style="color:#dd83f5" href="https://github.com/TopazTK/KH-ReFixed/issues">Re:Fixed Issues Page</a>! You can  
also see what was fixed beforehand so you do not have to report it, and can fix it if a  
workaround was provided!

If you need immediate help, you can join the <a style="color:#dd83f5" href="https://discord.gg/aGc7CyEJgv">Re:Fixed Discord Server</a> to get the  
help that you need! Folks can be a lil' slow to respond to ya because of life and work and whatnot, but trust  
me, no one will let you down and empty handed. There is always a solution!
