# A new dream, within a dream...

Re:Fixed is finaly getting another game on it's list! This time, it's **Dream Drop Distance**!

This game does not really have all that much to change, but one of the biggest changes I am planning to introduce is the ability to **toggle auto-dropping**.

Kinda gamechanging, extremely useful for those who are forgetful and don't stack on Dorp-Me-Nots like myself. With this simple toggle, you won't ever have to remember to drop again, demonstrated below:

Along with the introduction of DDD comes many fixes, tweaks, and some new features to both KH1 and KH2! I am excited to share them all with you in the near future.

I hope that all of you will be able to enjoy what's in store for Re:Fixed v3.00!
