# A Welcoming Message!

Heya, this is TopazTK. If you are seeing this **work**, it means that the Markdown parser *finally* decided to do it's job!

So yea, this is the official website for Re:Fixed, where all updates regarding it, now and future, will be posted and uploaded to for all of you to enjoy!

I gotta admit, I am not a wizard of web development but eh, if I can make a nice lookin' website I sure am satisfied.

Welp, nothing more to say for now, go over to the Re:Fixed Twitter Page for more updates, or join the Re:Fixed Discord Server for 24/7 interaction with others! Both of the links are in the Support section!
