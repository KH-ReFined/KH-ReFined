## Introduction:
We will be looking on how to correctly install **Kingdom Hearts II - Re:Fined v4.00** and above on Windows Computers.

To start, you will need the following downloaded:

- KINGDOM HEARTS HD 1.5+2.5 ReMIX  
  - _If you are using an unofficial copy, please make sure your vanilla game works before installing Re:Fined! Re:Fined does work as long as your unofficial copy works normally!_

- Kingdom Hearts II - Re:Fined

- OpenKH - Mod Manager  
  - Download openkh.zip from the latest build.  
    
  
Please also have the following downloaded and installed already if you do not already:

- Visual C++ Redistributable Runtimes All-in-One Package

 
## OpenKH Initial Setup:
In this section, we will be setting up OpenKH's Mods Manager to patch the necessary files to run Re:Fined 4.00.

- **Step 1:** Right click openkh.zip and extract the folder somewhere where it won't accidently get deleted.
eg: C:\Users\\[UserName]\Documents\OpenKH\

- **Step 2:** Go into your openkh folder and look for a program named OpenKh.Tools.ModsManager.exe and open it.

- **Step 3:** A window will pop up saying "Welcome to OpenKH Mods Manager"
You are going to click Next >, select PC Release via Epic Game Store, and then you are going to click the little folder icon to select the location of your game.
If you do not know where you have KINGDOM HEARTS HD 1.5+2.5 ReMIX installed, open up Epic Games Store, go into your library, right click KINGDOM HEARTS HD 1.5+2.5 ReMIX, click Manage, and then click the folder icon next to Installation. This will bring you to where it is downloaded.

- **Step 4:** Click Next > and choose weather you want to install OpenKH Panacea. For this tutorial, we will be installing and using Panacea.
OpenKH Panacea allows you to load your mods without modifying the game files.

- **Step 5:** On the next screen, you may choose to Launch via Epic Games. If you would like to, check this and then click Next >.

- **Step 6:**
Make sure KH2-25GB is checked, and then click Extract game data. This may take roughly fifteen minutes.
If you have already used OpenKH in the past, I recommend doing this step again with a completely fresh install of the game, that way any extracted data is guaranteed to not be accidently modified by a pre-existing modification.
If you encounter any errors extracting the game files, please either try again, or re-download your game!

- **Step 7:** After extraction, click Next > and then click Finish

It should then all be done! 

## Downloading and Patching in Re:Fined v4.00's files using OpenKH:
In this section, we will be downloading the necessary patches to properly run Re:Fined v4.00.

- **Step 1:** In OpenKH, select the Mods button on the top, and then select Install a new mod.
Under Add a new mod from GitHub, we will be pasting in KH-ReFined/KH2-MAIN, as seen in the screenshot below, and then will click Install.
  - Optional: Feel free to also add KH-ReFined/KH2-MultiAudio, KH-ReFined/KH2-VanillaOST, and KH-ReFined/KH2-VanillaEnemy as well for extra Re:Fined v4.00 features!
    - Note: KH-ReFined/KH2-MultiAudio takes a very long time to download and install, as it is a rather large repository! If it looks like the program is unresponsive, it is simply because it is downloading the files.

- **Step 2:** You will see Kingdom Hearts II - Re:Fined v4.00 added into your mods list. Tick the little box so a checkmark appears in it.

If you did install OpenKH Panacea, click Mod Loader ->  Build Only
If you have OpenKH set to run the game via EGS, select Build and Run. The game will load after it patches.
The mod will persist after you close the game, so you don't have to re-open OpenKH.

If you did not install OpenKH Panacea, click Patching -> Build and Patch
Sit back and let OpenKH do it's thing at this point. Depending on your PC, this might take between five to fifteen or more minutes. This may also take longer depending on if you downloaded and are implementing any additional addons as well.

A debug window will then open, signaling that the game is currently being patched.

When it is done patching, the debug window will close. You are free to close out of OpenKH.

## Installing Re:Fined v4.00:
In this section, we will be placing our new Re:Fined v4.00 installation files into our game directory.

- **Step 1:** Locate your game installation.

- **Step 2:** In your game installation folder, backup your original .exe by either moving or renaming KINGDOM HEARTS II FINAL MIX.exe somewhere or something different.

- **Step 3:** Open the ReFined-KH2-v4.05.zip file you downloaded earlier, and place KINGDOM HEARTS II FINAL MIX.exe and keystone.dll into your game directory folder.
If you get a box asking you if you would like to overwrite any data, select Yes
  - _The .exe's game icon may not update right away. This is due to Windows Icon caching and in no way affects Re:Fined._  


This is what your game installation folder should now look like: 

## Launching Re:Fined v4.00.
Congratulations! You are very close into launching Re:Fined v4.00!

- **Step 1:** Load up Epic Games Launcher.  
- **Step 2:** Start up KINGDOM HEARTS HD 1.5+2.5 ReMIX  
- **Step 3:** Start KINGDOM HEARTS II FINAL MIX as you would normally.

And there you go! Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix - Re:Fined v4.00 has been successfully installed!   
You will know it has worked when you select NEW GAME and you get the new options to select your controller prompts and skip the prologue!
